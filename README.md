# Etch-a-Sketch

This project is part of The Odin Project Foundation Course. The goal is to create an interactive drawing application using JavaScript and practice manipulating the DOM (Document Object Model).

---

## Learning Objectives

- **DOM Manipulation:** Gain experience selecting and modifying DOM elements dynamically.
- **Event Handling:** Learn how to add event listeners and respond to user interactions like mouse movements and clicks.
- **Grid-based Design:** Create and manage a grid layout dynamically with JavaScript.
- **CSS Integration:** Style the grid and implement hover effects for an interactive user experience.
- **Problem Solving:** Break down the requirements into smaller tasks and implement them step by step.
- **Responsive Design:** Adapt the grid size dynamically based on user input.

## Features

- **Interactive Drawing:** Users can draw on the grid by hovering over cells.
- **Customizable Grid Size:** Users can adjust the number of grid squares (e.g., 16x16, 32x32).
- **Reset Button:** A button to clear the grid and start fresh.
- **Dynamic Hover Effects:** Change the color of grid cells as the user interacts with them.
- **Optional Features (if implemented):**
  - Change colors dynamically.
  - Create a rainbow effect with random colors.
  - Enable an "eraser" mode to clear specific cells.
